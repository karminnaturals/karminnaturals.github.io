      application or give us
      in any other way (e.g., at conferences, stores, hotels, kiosks). Please see the section titled “Data Shared by
      You” for
      more information.
      <br>2. Automatic Information We Collect: We use “cookies”, pixels and similar technologies to receive and store
      certain types
      of information whenever you interact with us. Please see the section below, titled “Data that is Collected
